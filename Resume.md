## **PROJECTS UNDERTAKEN**
+ **Satellite Image Analysis (SIA) Platform** <br>
The SIA platform is the flagship product of Aventior’s Machine Learning and Computer Vision division. The software platform is built t
o improve the spatial resolution of the satellite images and to analyze satellite images for various objects of interest. The project involved preparing the training data for various deep learning model training by mathematically synthesizing the augmented images with annotations using various Digital Image Processing techniques. The solution involved the development of object detection algorithms using Python programming language and using Google’s TensorFlow framework for developing, training, testing, and deploying the deep learning model into the production environment. The research work revolved around experimentation with mathematical parameters like learning rates, frozen layers, initial weights, number of steps per epochs, the total number of epochs in an iteration, number of training images and annotations, images sizes, image aspect ratios, etc. <br>

+ **Infrastructure Detection and Change Monitoring**  <br>
For the urban infrastructure entities like buildings and sports facilities, detection algorithms were built to automate the process of identifying objects on pan-sharpened satellite images with a spatial resolution of 0.55m using KOMPSAT-3 images. It included the training for deep convolutional neural networks based on Faster-RCNN architecture and ResNet-50 backbone Neural Network configurations. The performance of 70% Mean Average Precision (mAP) at 65% Intersection Over Union (IOU) was achieved. The buildings were classified into multi-storied tall rise apartments, buildings with slanted roofs and buildings with flat roofs, whereas the sports facilities considered were Stadiums, Tennis Courts, Baseball Parks, and Soccer Fields. The object detection solutions were further modified to identify the changes in the objects using temporal satellite image data. Image processing techniques like binarization, OTSU thresholding technique contour identification with Chain approximation method, etc., were implemented to find the changes happening within the identified infrastructure objects. The objective was to identify the infrastructure changes occurring in an area to make economic growth assessment of a region in the future. <br>

+ **Car, Ships and Airplanes Detection** <br>
The object of this module within SIA platform was to provide the users the ability to perform vehicle detection within their regions of interest, to make it easier to monitor the movement of cars on the roads and of ships withing the water bodies using data from satellites with low revisit period. The aircraft detection solution was implemented to keep track of the aircraft inventory across various airports. The module used combinations of neural network architectures, inspired by RetinaNet and YOLO-v2 Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, implemented with Keras framework in Python. The experiments resulted in 50% AP at 50% IoU for cars, 70% AP at 50% IoU for ships, and airplanes.<br>

+ **Urban Super Resolution** <br>
The Urban Super-resolution module was developed as a necessity to improve the detection accuracy of various object detection algorithms. The performance of object detection heavily relies on the strengths of the features of objects within the images. The features strength can be increased by improving the spatial resolution of the satellite images. This was achieved using the deep convolutions generative adversarial neural networks (GAN). The synthetic data preparation required the development of mathematical models for image transformations, due to images coming from multiple sources with variable spatial resolutions. The solution was developed keeping in mind various image enhancement metrics like Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SMI), Information Fidelity Criterion (IFA), and Mean Square Error (MSE).  <br>

+ **Drone Image Analysis** <br>
The Drone Image Analysis platform was built to assist drone operators for various tasks using drone-captured imagery. The techniques used a combination of various Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. The platform was configured for two distinct use cases, first for the human detection for search and rescue missions and second for power lines and power transmission tower inspections. The human detection solution used ensembled neural networks which were independently designed to identify humans in drone imagery taken from a certain altitude. The ensemble approach ensured that the images captured at various angles and from various altitudes of the drone were processed and the human detection performance improved. The resultant accuracy of 93% was achieved with less than 3% False Negatives.<br>

+ **A platform for data restructuring and visual data analysis with Biotech and Pharmaceuticals domain.** <br>
The biotech and pharmaceuticals industry generate a tremendous amount of data every day, most of which is in unstructured form. Converting this data into a standard is necessary to perform statistical analysis and derive meaningful insights using data visualization. A unique platform was developed for the Biotech and Pharmaceuticals industry, which helped them in converting their unstructured or semi-structured data into a standard structure and further run statistical and visual analytics on the structured data. The data restructuring step involved proprietary pattern matching algorithms for document processing, which heavily relied on unsupervised machine learning algorithms like clustering, supervised algorithms like entity recognition in natural language processing. The platform also relied on state-of-art AI techniques like Computer Vision, Speech-To-Text, and Optical Character Recognition engines. An important feature of the platform allowed the text data to be extracted from the label on digital scans of pathology slides and create records in the standard structured output. <br>

## **POSTGRADUATION DETAILS**
+ **Dissertation title : Mathematical modeling of the driving band’s engraving process and its effects on projectile velocity** <br>
_M.Tech. Dissertation Thesis, DIAT, Pune India_ <br> 
The field of internal ballistics still relies heavily on traditional empirical relations for mathematically modeling various processes. Many empirical relations developed are based on approximation of the experimental data, generated under some test conditions. Due to advancements in the field, the ballistics hardware has undergone tremendous changes, mostly due to new materials and optimized design of the components. The dissertation research project focused on a mechanical component on the projectile, called “Driving Band”. The component is fitted near the base of the projectile, and is designed to keep the projectile in place under gravitational forces or until a minimum amount of pressure is generated at the base so at to propel the projectile with the desired velocity, and achieve maximum possible muzzle velocity at the barrel end. The projectile’s muzzle velocity determines the range and impact velocity of the projectile and hence is the governing factor in the intermediate and external ballistics. The driving band is usually a metallic ring with trapezoidal cross-section, and hence the dimensions of the trapezoid play an important role in the resistance offered by the projectile to the pressure generated from the combustion process and hence affects the muzzle velocity of the projectile. When the combustion pressure behind the projectile increases, the forces cause deformation in the driving band. The traditional models assume the driving bands undergo only compressive deformation. The research work considered the compressive and bending forces that cause the driving band to deform. The deformation is also a function of trapezoidal dimensions and the material of the driving band and hence the variation of the muzzle velocity with variations in driving band’s geometry is calculated. The mathematical models for the driving band’s deformation consider it to be a cantilever beam. The models are simulated using MATLAB. The standard dimensions and results from lumped parameter models were used to validate the results of the compressive and bending forces of the developed model, and the geometrical parameters were then varied to study the effects of the dimensions on projectile’s muzzle velocity.

## **GRADUATION DETAILS**
+ Design of Special Purpose Machine for dish antenna curling operation. <br> 
_BE Project Thesis, University of Pune, Pune, India_ <br>
With the introduction of Elliptical Dish Antennas (EDA) for televisions in India, many satellite television operators and service provider companies were trying to roll-out their customized dish-antennas into the market. At the time of these roll-outs, there did not exist any EDA manufacturing machines in the market. Tata-Sky is one of the dominant satellite Television service providers in India and has partnered with multiple vendors across the country to develop these antennas. However, due to a lack of technologies to automate these processes, many vendors faced the slow delivery of their products. The most complex stage of manufacturing the EDA is the final curling operation. The curling operation is performed on the edges of the EDA to provide better strength and safety. Due to elliptical shape, this operation cannot be performed on traditional lathe machines. The project was to design and develop Special Purpose Machine (SPM), which can curl the edges of an EDA without shearing and tearing of the sheet. All the research work was sponsored by JKC Automobiles, which is a renowned SPM manufacturer in Pune. To gain a proper understanding of the requirements and potential solutions, and research was conducted to study various sheet metal processing techniques used within the industry. After visiting various manufacturing companies within Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad regions, the final decision of a hydraulic press was taken. Experiments were performed to study the force requirements for the curling operations which confirmed the decision of the hydraulic press system. The experiment involved the design of an experimental setup within any college sheet metal workshop and used a lever mechanism for force analysis. The hydraulic and electric circuits were designed in AutoCAD. Many aspects of machine design such as safety of the operator, system failures, maintenance procedures, ergonomics of the machine, etc. were considered while designing the machine. The components for the machine were selected from catalogs from various vendors partnered with JKC Automobiles. The components were assembled, and the machine was tested for performance. <br>

+ Analysis of battery ignition system  <br>
_Exhibited the working principles in TechSpark Exhibition, SAE India Chapter_ <br>
 The working principles and components of a battery ignition system were studied and exhibited in a technical exhibition hosted by SAE India. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) India conducts an annual exhibition across various member universities and colleges. As a part of these exhibitions, the member students are asked to exhibit their topics of interest in the event. Exhibiting the scientific principles of the Battery Ignition system required a detailed study on the components and the working principles of the system. An electric potential difference of around 20000V is required at the spark plug in a gasoline engine working under Otto-cycle, whereas a motor-bike usually carries a battery of 12V. A sufficient voltage needs to be generated so that the spark of 20000V is generated 25 times per second considering a single-cylinder four-stroke gasoline engine running at a minimum of 3000 RPM. An in-depth study was conducted to understand the designing principles of the step-up transformer, the capacitor, and the supporting electrical circuit.
